## Introduction

Welcome to the Movie Data Analysis project!

In this project, we conducted a data analysis of a movie dataset, with the goal of identifying the best and worst movies and analyzing the success of franchising movies compared to non-franchising movies.

The purpose of this project was to gain insights into the movie industry and better understand factors that contribute to the success or failure of a film. By analyzing a dataset of movies, we were able to identify trends and patterns that can help us understand what makes a movie successful or unsuccessful.

## Data Used

In our analysis, the following data points were very important to extract some insights for each movie in the dataset:
- Budget
- Revenue
- Popularity
- Vote average rating

These data points allowed us to assess the financial performance of the movies, as well as their popularity among audiences and critics.

## Technologies Used

The programming language used for this project was Python, and we utilized the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

These libraries allowed us to effectively manipulate and visualize the data in order to draw meaningful insights from it.
